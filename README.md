# Send_Email 
- Send Email on EC2

## - If you can't sign in to your email client, you might see one of these errors:
- "Username and password not accepted"
- "Invalid credentials"
- You're asked to enter your username and password over and over

## Step 1: Check your password
- If you have these problems or can’t sign in, first check to make sure you’re using the right password.

## Step 2: Try these troubleshooting steps
- Update your email client to the latest version.
- Use an App Password: If you use 2-Step Verification, try signing in with an App Password.
  - Important: If you sign in with OAuth, use your regular Google password.
- Allow less secure apps: If you don't use 2-Step Verification, you might need to allow less secure apps to access your account.
- If you recently changed your Gmail password, you might need to re-enter your Gmail account information or completely repeat your Gmail account setup on your other email client.
- If the tips above didn't help, visit https://www.google.com/accounts/DisplayUnlockCaptcha and follow the steps on the page.
- The email client's sign-in method might be insecure. Try signing in directly on the Gmail app.
- Make sure your mail app isn't set to check for new email too frequently. If your mail app checks for new messages more than once every 10 minutes, the app’s access to your account could be blocked.
